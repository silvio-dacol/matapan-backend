# Matapan

Repository following [the MVP code structure](docs/mvp_code_structure.md).
The local account workspace supports account creation, reviewed Revolut CSV
imports, imported transactions with provenance, dated cash reports, and manual
balance confirmation when imported history is incomplete.

Start the backend using [backend/README.md](backend/README.md), then open a second
PowerShell terminal from the repository root (Node.js 20.19+ or 22.12+):

```powershell
cd frontend
npm.cmd ci
npm.cmd run dev
```

Open http://127.0.0.1:5173. The Vite server forwards `/api` and `/health` to the
local API at http://127.0.0.1:8000 and preserves the browser's import session cookie.
`npm.cmd` works even when PowerShell blocks the `npm.ps1` wrapper.
See [frontend/README.md](frontend/README.md) for the workflow and browser checks.
For a step-by-step walkthrough, see [the easy frontend guide](docs/easy_frontend_use.md).

## Progress recap

Updated **2026-10-15**, including the checkpoint/reconciliation implementation.
Matapan currently provides the first working account-import slice. It is **not yet
the complete MVP** defined by [architecture v0.6](docs/mvp_architecture.md).
The slice names below follow [the implementation guide](docs/mvp_code_structure.md);
they do not imply that all architecture milestones are complete.

### What is implemented

- **Local backend and persistence:** FastAPI, SQLite/SQLAlchemy, exact decimal
  money storage, and incremental Alembic migrations (`0001_account_balances` and
  `0002_revolut_imports`). Startup checks the migration revision; existing data is
  preserved rather than recreated.
- **Accounts:** create, list, and read accounts; delete empty accounts through the
  API. Accounts with balances, transactions, or import history cannot be deleted.
  The current slice uses one currency per account context, with separate Revolut
  Current and Savings contexts.
- **Revolut CSV import:** one documented English bank-statement format, with
  product/currency mapping, exact amounts and fees, booked movements, original
  source fields, warnings, and dated running-balance evidence. See the
  [supported format and limits](docs/importers/revolut/revolut_csv.md).
- **Reviewed, atomic imports:** preview, refresh, confirm, and cancel; session-bound
  previews expire after 30 minutes. Exact reimports are idempotent. Overlapping
  files are reviewed per row, and ambiguous matches require an explicit decision
  to keep separate, link to an existing transaction, or skip. Multiple source rows
  can retain provenance for one canonical transaction. Commit revalidates matches
  and rolls back financial writes on failure.
- **Dated cash reporting:** account activity and source provenance, manual dated
  balance confirmation, and as-of reports. Missing balances remain unknown;
  future evidence is excluded from past reports. Conflicting observations are
  retained and make the value unavailable; older evidence is labeled as carried
  forward. Account cash is shown as a partial financial picture.
- **Timed checkpoints and reconciliation (Slice 2):** confirm a booked balance
  with a date, time, and UTC offset; explicitly configure the timezone of imported
  statement timestamps. The first timed confirmation provides the baseline, and
  later balances can be calculated from accepted movements after that checkpoint.
  Consecutive checkpoints expose gaps and proposed synthetic "ghost" adjustments.
  Creation, revision, and retirement require approval and preserve evidence and
  audit history. New imports recalculate proposals automatically and mark changed
  approvals as needing review. Zero residual ghosts can be retired on confirmation.
  Ghosts remain separate from real activity and are never added to the confirmed
  balance. A new migration adds these records without replacing existing data.
- **Working frontend:** a React/TypeScript account workspace with account creation,
  statement upload, duplicate and invalid-row review, import confirmation and
  cancellation, paginated activity, dated reports, and manual balance confirmation.
  The layout supports desktop and mobile. This is implemented beyond the
  placeholders mentioned in the original repository guidance.
- **Documentation and checks:** backend/frontend setup instructions, step-by-step
  [API](docs/easy_backend_api_use.md) and
  [frontend](docs/easy_frontend_use.md) guides, synthetic parser/import fixtures,
  backend tests, and Playwright browser tests using a disposable database.

### What still needs to be done

The core of **Slice 2: reconciliation** is implemented. Remaining limitations and
subsequent work, in the guide's suggested order:

1. **Remaining reconciliation limitations:** legacy date-only observations retain
   their original semantics and are not assigned invented times. Timed calculations
   require an explicit statement timezone; ambiguous/nonexistent daylight-saving
   timestamps block the calculation, with per-row time correction still to be
   implemented. Conflicting confirmations at the same instant block approval;
   explicit conflict resolution remains work below. History coverage stays
   unverified, even when a ghost makes the arithmetic match. Before the first
   timed confirmation the projected balance is unavailable, not zero. The existing
   dated report remains an evidence view; use **Calculate from checkpoint** for
   transaction-derived balances. Manual transaction entry remains proposed below.
2. **Observation and review lifecycle:** allow explicit selection/resolution of
   conflicting balance evidence while retaining originals; make duplicate decisions
   reversible with an audit trail; provide an import-history view and clearer
   coverage/reconciliation diagnostics. The current preview refresh and activity
   provenance do not constitute the full history/review experience.
   **Manual transaction entry is also a proposed addition:** let the user add a
   dated movement to a selected account with an exact signed amount, matching
   currency, description, and explicit manual provenance. This is not implemented
   and is not an explicit requirement of architecture v0.6. Keep it distinct from
   balance confirmation and synthetic reconciliation adjustments. A later import
   of a matching movement must offer duplicate review and preserve both origins
   if linked. Manual movements must not silently change a confirmed balance or
   imply complete history; corrections should retain an audit trail.
3. **Brokerage (Slice 3):** verify a representative Interactive Brokers export and
   implement preview/review/import for securities, dated holdings/valuations, and
   separate currency cash balances. Treat aggregate equity/NAV as reconciliation
   evidence so it cannot be counted again alongside cash and positions. No broker
   importer is implemented yet.
4. **Multi-currency net worth (Slice 4):** reporting-currency settings, dated FX with
   explicit source and rounding rules, manual assets/liabilities and their dated
   valuations, and consolidated cash + investments + assets - liabilities. Add
   component drill-down, meaningful historical comparisons, freshness and
   actionable reliability warnings. Current account cash reports are not a
   consolidated net-worth report.
5. **Safe self-hosted release:** private access/authentication appropriate to the
   deployment, Docker/Compose packaging, persistent storage configuration, and
   documented, tested consistent backup/restore. Current development servers bind
   to loopback; production deployment is not complete.
6. **Complete MVP acceptance coverage:** extend tests for the new features,
   including late-import adjustment revision, no double-counted cash/NAV,
   multi-currency valuation, preserved correction history, and restored-report
   reproducibility. Use architecture sections 8, 13.9, and 14.9 as the acceptance
   checklist before declaring the MVP complete.

**Future account organization update:** group accounts by institution in the
frontend (for example, Revolut or SEB), retaining the existing account appearance
within each group. Each account should belong to a reusable institution record.
When creating an account, let the user select an existing institution from a
dropdown or add a new institution without leaving the form. Multiple products
and currencies can belong to the same institution while remaining separate
accounts. Migrate existing institution names and account associations without
losing financial history; review ambiguous name variations rather than silently
merging institutions. Institution membership does not by itself mean that an
importer for that institution is supported. This update is planned, not implemented.

**After the MVP:** additional institution adapters (SEB, Intesa Sanpaolo, China
Construction Bank, Alipay, and WeChat), broader export variants, transfer linking,
categorization, cash-flow/performance analytics, inflation, recurring imports, and
optional AI. Export-download notes in `docs/importers/` do not mean those adapters
exist. These are later extensions, not prerequisites for the first complete MVP.

### Verification of the current slice

Checks run for this recap on **2026-10-15**:

- Backend: `python -m pytest -q` — **103 passed**, including checkpoint arithmetic,
  ghost revision/retirement, concurrent approvals, rollback, and restore tests.
- Frontend: `npm.cmd run build` — **passed**, including strict TypeScript checks.
- Browser: `npm.cmd test` — **14 passed** across desktop and mobile.
- Ruff lint and format checks passed. Tests also check migration/schema agreement.

The repository includes backend checks for validation, exact money, migrations,
foreign keys, persistence, dated reports, reimports, overlapping files, duplicate
decisions, session expiry, concurrent commits, and rollback. Browser tests cover
the account/import journey and recovery paths on desktop and mobile.

See [backend checks](backend/README.md) and
[frontend checks](frontend/README.md) for commands and environment requirements.
Only synthetic fixtures and disposable test databases should be used for checks.

# When updating the version
